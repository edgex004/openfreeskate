# openfreeskate
Open source design for 3D printed driftskate/freeskate

![alt text](https://github.com/edgex004/openfreeskate/blob/master/rev1.jpg?raw=true)

### Design 
The skates are made up of three top-level modules that you need to print:
 2 Decks
 2 Trucks
 4 Bearing spacers

### Additional parts required for build:
 4 M4x15mm bolts (or cut down longer M4's)
 4 M4 nuts
 4 M8x80mm partially threaded bolts
 4 M8 locking nuts

### Note
The bottom of the M8 bolts can just barely strike the ground when the skates are tipped over. This can be avoided by either cutting the bolts short or by adding M8 washers near the head of the bolt. You can probably also use M8x70mm bolts instead of cutting, but that will leave threading underneath the bearing spacers.
 
The width of the bearing spacers needs to be adjusted to fit your choice of wheels/bearings.

The default design is compatible with JMKRide Performance Wheels/Bearings. ( ```bearing_to_bearing=26.5;```)

I do not own any other sets of trucks or decks, so I am assuming this design is not compatible with any existing products on the market. If anyone wants to request specific bolt sizes or hole spacing for compatibility reasons, simply send me the requested dimensions and I can implement them in the next revision.

### Disclaimer

I use these skates personally. However, I cannot vouch for the safety or validity of this design. Anyone who chooses to use this design does so at their own risk. The printer/user should perform their own due diligence, materials choice, and testing prior to riding on these skates.
